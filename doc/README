Intro
-----
Slimcoin is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin, innovations such as proof-of-burn
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 bin/32/slimcoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit)
 bin/32/slimcoind (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/slimcoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit)
 bin/64/slimcoind (headless, 64-bit)

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 9901 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  Slimcoin works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the Slimcoin network.


Upgrade
-------
All your existing coins/transactions should be intact with the upgrade.
To upgrade from 0.2, first backup wallet
slimcoind backupwallet <destination_backup_file>
Then shutdown slimcoind by
slimcoind stop
Remove files inside wallet directory other than wallet.dat and slimcoin.conf
Start up the new slimcoind (0.3.0). It would start re-download of block chain.

Intro
-----
Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.
